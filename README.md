# Luckydrawz

This is a Lottery App built with React where users can buy tickets and check if they've won based on a defined winning condition. The app utilizes random number generation to create tickets and demonstrates component-based architecture and state management using React's `useState` hook.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](#).

## Features

- Generate a new lottery ticket with random numbers.
- Check if the ticket meets the winning condition.
- Responsive and clean UI design.

## Technologies Used

- React (for building the UI)
- Vite (for fast development environment)
- JavaScript/JSX (for logic and structure)
- CSS (for styling)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Luckydrawz.git
   cd Luckydrawz
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

- `App.jsx`: The main application component that renders the `Lottery` component.
- `Lottery.jsx`: Manages the ticket generation and win condition checking.
- `Buy.jsx`: A button component for purchasing a new ticket.
- `Ticket.jsx`: Displays the generated lottery ticket.
- `TicketNum.jsx`: Renders individual numbers on the ticket.
- `helper.js`: Contains utility functions for generating tickets and calculating sums.
- `index.css`: Contains the styling for the application.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## How It Works

The app is built with React and uses the `useState` hook for managing the lottery ticket state. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Ticket Generation: A new lottery ticket is generated by creating an array of random numbers when the user clicks the "Get New Ticket" button.
2. Winning Condition: The app checks if the generated ticket meets the defined winning condition (e.g., the sum of the numbers equals 15).
3. Display: The app displays the ticket numbers and informs the user if they have won.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance Winning Conditions: Allow for more complex winning conditions and patterns.
- Multiple Tickets: Implement functionality to allow users to generate and keep track of multiple tickets.
- User Accounts: Enable user registration and login to save ticket history and preferences.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Random Number Generation: Learning to use functions to generate random numbers efficiently and how to represent them visually in the UI.
- State Management: Using React’s `useState` hook for managing the state of the ticket and understanding how to update state based on user interactions.
- Component Reusability: Structuring components to enhance reusability and maintainability, like breaking down the ticket display into individual components.

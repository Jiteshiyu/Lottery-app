## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [Luckydrawz](https://luckydrawz.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Generate a new lottery ticket with random numbers.
- Check if the ticket meets the winning condition.
- Responsive and clean UI design.

## Technologies Used

- React (for building the UI)
- Vite (for fast development environment)
- JavaScript/JSX (for logic and structure)
- CSS (for styling)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Luckydrawz.git
   cd Luckydrawz
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## How It Works

The app is built with React and uses the `useState` hook for managing the lottery ticket state.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Ticket Generation:** A new lottery ticket is generated when the user clicks the "Get New Ticket" button.
2. **Winning Condition:** The app checks if the generated ticket meets the defined winning condition.
3. **Display:** The app displays the ticket numbers and informs the user if they have won.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhance Winning Conditions:** Allow for more complex winning conditions and patterns.
- **Multiple Tickets:** Implement functionality to allow users to generate and keep track of multiple tickets.
- **User Accounts:** Enable user registration and login to save ticket history and preferences.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Random Number Generation:** Learning to use functions to generate random numbers efficiently and how to represent them visually in UI.
- **State Management:** Using Reactâ€™s `useState` hook for managing the state of the ticket and understanding how to update state based on user interactions.
- **Component Reusability:** Structuring components to enhance reusability and maintainability, like breaking down the ticket display into individual components.
